I am a first-year PhD in the Department of Economics at Stockholm University. 

My research interests include urban, gender, and public economics. 

I previously worked as a predoctoral research fellow at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research (SIEPR) with Professor Rebecca Diamond. Before this, I earned the Master of Philosophy in Economics at the University of Oxford, and a BA in Economics at the University of Manchester.
